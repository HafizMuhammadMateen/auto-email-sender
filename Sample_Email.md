In my **FYP**, I developed an advanced deep learning-based **Retinal Disease Detection System** using fundus images, incorporating segmentation with models like ***Attention-UNet*** and ***DeepLabV3+***. The project aims to assist ophthalmologists in early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy ... a real-world healthcare problem.

With strong foundations in *AI/ML/DL, Python, MERN Stack, and WordPress*, Iâ€™m passionate about solving meaningful problems and learning in collaborative environments.
